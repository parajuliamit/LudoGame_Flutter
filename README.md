# Ludo Game
This is a Ludo game application for android, ios and web. This let's you play ludo in two modes i.e. Real Dice Mode and Virtual Dice Mode. You can choose numbers players from 2 to 4. There are cool sound effects in each move of the token. 

This application was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic period using free time. This was my first interactive game from scratch. This was total test of my skill, patience and problem solving. It took me around 3 weeks to come upto the final version.
